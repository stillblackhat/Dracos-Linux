### Build from source 
had always been built from codes instead of installer,this will stimulate users in indonesia to stay creative and to build the spirit of opensource.

### Repository

### Heavy Control
We need to recognize this operating system Very Dificult Because Dracos in build from source code, thus forcing us to compile when installing a package or software, which of course will arise the possibility of system failure and other system vulnerabilities.

### Always from terminal
None of every singel tool that was installed inside the OS uses GUI. CLI will always consider to particularly openbox to ease the users in need of multi terminal in applying Penetration Testing
